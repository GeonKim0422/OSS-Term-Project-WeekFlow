# OSS-Term-Project-WeekFlow
Open Source Planner for Slack-Based Backward Scheduling

Unfortunately, since this project is the university project for students, we are not receiving any contribution until December 2025.

Project Goal

An open-source scheduler that automatically calculates the user’s available time throughout the week—based on fixed routines such as sleep, wake-up time, and classes—and then assigns tasks to the most suitable time slots.

Project Vision

A smart planner that goes beyond simple schedule recording by analyzing the structure of free time so users can utilize their time more efficiently.
The project aims to become an open-source ecosystem where anyone can extend features and contribute.
