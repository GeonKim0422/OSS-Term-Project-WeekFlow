    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks out the repository code.

        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          # Cache settings for Gradle (if using Gradle) or Maven
          cache: 'gradle'

      # Step 3: Grant execute permission to the Gradle wrapper
      - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
        run: chmod +x gradlew

      # Step 4: Run tests and build the project using the Gradle wrapper.
      - name: Run tests and build with Gradle
        run: ./gradlew clean build

      # The 'build' task typically includes running all unit tests (like FreeTimeDetectorTest).
